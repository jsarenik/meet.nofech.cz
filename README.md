# meet.nofech.cz
Static clone of Jitsi-Meet front-end served by Caddy2

My setup is pretty simple:

 * `~/src/jitsi-meet` is clone of https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet.git (`npm install; make;`)
 * `~/web/meet.jit.si` is clone of https://github.com/jsarenik/meet.jit.si
 * `~/web/meet.nofech.cz` is this repository
 
Then the important scripts are `./update-*.sh` and `./statify.sh`.
Feel free to ask.
